# Enable CodeQL to secure your source code

_Learn to identify, resolve, and prevent insecure coding patterns._

## Welcome

In this exercise, we will explore using GitHub code scanning, powered by [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/), to identify common coding practices that can lead to security vulnerabilities. During this exercise, we will enable code scanning on your repository to identify, remediate, and prevent vulnerabilities.

Code scanning is part of the [GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS)](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) product suite. All of the features of Advanced Security are 100% free for open source, public repositories.

- **Who is this for**: Developers, security engineers, open source maintainers.
- **What you'll learn**: We'll show you how to enable code scanning and identify SQL injection vulnerabilities with CodeQL.
- **What you'll build**: A secure software development pipeline that allows you to identify and prevent new security vulnerabilities from being introduced into your production code.
- **Prerequisites**: In this exercise, you'll need a baseline knowledge of GitHub concepts such as pull requests, GitHub Actions, and source code. You'll also need to be familiar with the concepts of Static Application Security Testing (SAST). Don't worry, we'll explain the complex parts for you üôÇ.
- **How long**: This exercise is four steps long and takes less than 30 minutes to complete.

### How to start this exercise

Simply copy the exercise to your account, then give your favorite Octocat (Mona) **about 20 seconds** to prepare the first lesson, then **refresh the page**.

<summary>Having trouble? ü§∑</summary><br/>

When copying the exercise, we recommend the following settings:

- For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
- We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).

If the exercise isn't ready in 20 seconds:

1. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page.
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the issue created in your repository.
3. If the page doesn't refresh automatically, please check the [Actions](../../actions) tab.
   - Check to see if a job is running. Sometimes it simply takes a bit longer.
   - If the page shows a failed job, please submit an issue. Nice, you found a bug! üêõ
