## Step 2: Review and Triage CodeQL Alerts

Now we will review the CodeQL scan results, triage an alert, and create a GitHub issue to track an alert.

### What is CWE

Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for hardware and software weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Think of it as a way to describe and categorize security issues in an application's source code. For more information on CWEs, see the Wikipedia article [Common Weakness Enumeration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Weakness_Enumeration).

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: View the status of a CodeQL scan

1. In the top navigation, select the **Actions** tab.

1. If needed, wait a moment for the CodeQL run to finish (about 4 minutes).

1. Click on the **CodeQL Setup** workflow run entry to open a page showing more details.

   > üí° Tip: The workflow run contains additional CodeQL information such as the run duration, logs, and analysis artifacts.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Review an Alert

1. In the top navigation, select the **Security** tab.

1. In the left navigation, find the **Vulnerability alerts** area and select the **Code scanning** option.

1. (Optional) Use the filters and search bar to explore the open and closed security alerts, including from the CodeQL scan.

#### Alert status and location

The main area of the alert provides the resolution status, affected branch, code location, and classification information like severity and [CVE identification number](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories#cve-identification-numbers).

> üí° Tip: Clicking the **Show paths** link will provide additional insights about the alert's data flow from user input (source), through the application, and when it is acted on (sink).

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Dismiss an Alert

1. On the alert page, in the top right, click **Dismiss alert** dropdown.

1. Select any reason and add a short explanation then click the **Dismiss alert** button.

    - The alert state will change to `Dismissed` and an audit trail entry will be added.

1. Navigate back to **Security** tab and **Code scanning alerts** area.

1. Click the **1 Closed** text to switch to a view showing closed alerts.
