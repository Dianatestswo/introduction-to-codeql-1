## Step 3: Review and Triage CodeQL Alerts

With our pull request changes now reviewed by CodeQL, let's take a moment to learn about managing alerts.

GitHub provides a dedicated **Security** tab for securely managing all security related issues. CodeQL saves alerts using the same standard as many other analysis tools with the results showing up under the **Code scanning** area.

### What information do alerts provide?

The main area of an alert provides the resolution status, affected branch, code location, and classification information like severity and [CVE identification number](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories#cve-identification-numbers).

<!-- > üí° Tip: Clicking the **Show paths** link will provide additional insights about the alert's data flow from user input (source), through the application, and when it is acted on (sink). -->

### What is 'CWE'

Many of the patterns CodeQL scans for come from existing databases of vulnerabilities.

The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for hardware and software weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Think of it as a way to describe and categorize security issues in an application's source code. For more information on CWEs, see the Wikipedia article [Common Weakness Enumeration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Weakness_Enumeration).
